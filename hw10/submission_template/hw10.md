# Task 1: Data Science Careers

# Task 2: Highs and Lows

- What were the highlights of the class for you?
    
    I liked the assignments where we pulled Reddit data by using its API. I've been thinking about learning Notion API and integrate it into my current Notion workspace, and that was a good practice for me to get started and know what to expect.
    
- What could have been done better? How?
    
    I'd love to learn more about how data science is applied in real life by studying industrial examples. The lecture materials and assignments do help us gain data science skills, but I still don't completely understand how those skills are applied in real-life data handling. 
    
- How did this course impact the future you see for yourself (if at all)?
    
    It definitely opened the option of going into data science related field for me, or applying data science into fields I'm interested in. Also, I actually gained valuable Googling skills — no joke. After this class, I think knowing how to Google for CS is actually an important skill.
    
    - A couple of you have shared how this helped you in job interviews or land internships. I’d LOVE to hear these anecdotes if you’re willing to share.
        
        N/A :(((((
